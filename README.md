Musibuk is a web application designed around the practice needs of a musician. It provides a clean interface that lets users create exercises and folders.    
Each exercise provides tools like Metronome (tempo click), a stop watch to track how long you are practicing and a webcam to check if your form is correct.    
The app also tracks the progress of the user over the last 7 days. It provides bar graph visualizations showing the Time and Beats Per Minute achieved during a particular day's practice session.    
On the folder page, the app also shows the total time all the exercises were practiced in the folder over the last 7 days.    

Here are some screenshots of the app:
